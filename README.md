# Portfolio
The genesis of my professional portfolio.

## Description

For the start of my web development journey, having a working portfolio is imperative. This site serves as the jump off for what will become a polished and professional portfolio.


- The main motivation behind the color scheme of mostly white and violet is what I believe to represent a cool and calmed web environment.
- This project was necessary because everything was coded from scratch through trial, error, and reading through many documents.
- Since I didn't have coding experience, this was a great crash course into all the concepts of writing and styling code.
- Coding from scratch taught me there WILL be bugs in making the perfect website. Also, going in blind isn't great so create a wireframe and use it as a guide, not a strict enforcer, be fluid.
